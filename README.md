# **Government Property Compliance Visualization**

## **Project Overview**  
This project provides interactive data visualizations to analyze and monitor compliance with **FAR 52.245-1** and **DFARS 252.245-7005** guidelines for government property management. The solution helps stakeholders track contractor performance, identify audit issues, and optimize asset management using powerful insights.

**Note**: This project uses a **synthetic, fake dataset** generated for demonstration purposes only. No proprietary or sensitive information was used in the creation of this project.

## **Explanation of Metrics**
Audit_Issues:

Represents the average number of audit issues identified for each contractor.
Lower values are better, as fewer issues indicate stronger compliance and property management practices.
Lost_Assets:

Represents the average number of assets lost by each contractor.
High values (e.g., Contractor_1 with 325 lost assets) highlight inefficiencies in inventory management.
Compliance_Score:

Measures the overall compliance performance of the contractor, typically on a scale up to 100.
Higher values are better, indicating strong adherence to government property management guidelines.

## **Key Insights**
Contractor_1:

Highest Lost Assets (325), which stands out in red, indicating significant inventory mismanagement.
Despite the high lost assets, the Compliance Score remains very high (99.93), suggesting that the audit issues might not heavily penalize their overall compliance.

Contractor_10: High Lost Assets (252) and a relatively high number of Audit Issues (7.19).
Still maintains a strong Compliance Score of 99.91, though performance issues are visible.

Contractor_2: Lowest Lost Assets (89) and moderate Audit Issues (6.81).
Compliance score of 99.73, which is lower compared to others but still strong.

Contractors 4-9: Generally perform better with fewer Lost Assets and fewer Audit Issues.

Their Compliance Scores remain consistently high, which reflects stable and efficient property management practices.
